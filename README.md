# FoolCompiler

In this report we show the steps needed to build a simple compiler for an educational programming language called Functional Object Oriented Language (FOOL). Nowadays very few people build compilers or interpreters for mainstream programming languages. On the other hand knowing the theory and the practice behind this discipline should be an important achievement on the life of a computer scientist. Not only because we can understand better the functions and the peculiarities of the languages that we use every day but we can be better developers by knowing all the processes that our code passes through until it become machine code and get executed by the hardware.
